Recall that tibbles are lists of vectors.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/list-columns/tibble.png", dpi = image_dpi)
```

Usually, these vectors are _atomic vectors_, so the elements in the columns are single values, like "a" or 1.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/list-columns/tibble-atomic.png", dpi = image_dpi)
```

Tibbles can also have columns that are lists. These columns are (appropriately) called _list columns_.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(
  "images/list-columns/tibble-list-col.png", dpi = image_dpi
)
```

List columns are more flexible than normal, atomic vector columns. Lists can contain anything, so a list column can be made up of atomic vectors, other lists, tibbles, etc.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(
  "images/list-columns/tibble-list-col-vectors.png", 
  dpi = image_dpi
)
```

As you'll see, this can be a useful way to store data. In this chapter, you'll learn how to create list columns, how to turn list columns back into normal columns, and how to manipulate list columns. 

## Creating

Typically, you'll create list columns by manipulating an existing tibble. There are three primary ways to create list columns:

* `nest()`
* `summarize()` and `list()`
* `mutate()` and `map()`

### `nest()`

`countries` is a simplified version of `dcldata::gm_countries`, which contains Gapminder data on 197 countries.

```{r}
countries <-
  gm_countries %>% 
  select(name, region_gm4, un_status, un_admission, income_wb_2017)

countries
```

The tidyr function `nest()` creates list columns of tibbles. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(
  "images/list-columns/tibble-list-col-tibbles.png", dpi = image_dpi
)
```

Pass `nest()` the names of the columns to put into each individual tibble. `nest()` will create one row for each unique value of the remaining variables. For example, say we select just two columns from `countries`

```{r}
countries %>% 
  select(region_gm4, name) 
```

and then nest `name`.

```{r}
regions <-
  countries %>% 
  select(region_gm4, name) %>% 
  nest(countries = name)

regions
```

`nest()` created one tibble for each `region_gm4`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(
  "images/list-columns/regions.png", 
  dpi = image_dpi
)
```

Each of these tibbles contains all the countries that belong to the continent.

```{r}
regions$countries[[1]]
```

The entire column is a list.

```{r}
typeof(regions$countries)
```

If we nest multiple variables, the individual tibbles will have multiple columns. 

```{r}
regions_data <-
  countries %>% 
  nest(data = c(name, un_status, un_admission, income_wb_2017))

regions_data
```

```{r}
regions_data$data[[1]]
```

You can specify columns to nest using the same syntax as `select()`.

```{r}
countries %>% 
  nest(data = !region_gm4)
```

You can also create multiple list columns at once.

```{r}
countries %>% 
  nest(countries = name, data = c(name, contains("un"), income_wb_2017))
```

### `summarize()` and `list()`

You've used `group_by()` and `summarize()` to collapse groups into single rows. We can also use `summarize()` to create a list column, where each element is a vector, list, or tibble. 

If you supply `list()` with multiple atomic vectors, it will create a list of atomic vectors.

```{r}
list(c(1, 2, 3), c("a", "b", "c"))
```

We can use `summarize()` and `list()`  to create a list of atomic vectors where each vector corresponds to one `region_gm4`. For example, the following creates a list column of countries. 

```{r}
countries_collapsed <-
  countries %>% 
  group_by(region_gm4) %>% 
  summarize(countries = list(name))

countries_collapsed
```

The `countries` column is similar to the one  created earlier with `nest()`, except each element is an atomic vector, not a tibble. 

```{r}
typeof(countries_collapsed$countries[[1]])
```

What if we want to manipulate each vector before creating the list column? For example, say we want to arrange all country names alphabetically. The following doesn't work:

```{r error=TRUE}
countries %>% 
  group_by(region_gm4) %>% 
  summarize(countries = sort(name))
```

You need to collect all the atomic vectors into a list.

```{r}
countries %>% 
  group_by(region_gm4) %>% 
  summarize(countries = list(sort(name)))
```

Here's another example, which only stores in `countries` only the countries that begin with "A".

```{r}
a_countries <-
  countries %>% 
  group_by(region_gm4) %>% 
  summarize(countries = list(str_subset(name, "^A")))

a_countries

a_countries$countries[[1]]
```

### `mutate()`

The third way to create a list column is use to `rowwise()` and `mutate()`. For example, the following creates a list column where the element for each country is a vector of random numbers.

```{r}
countries %>% 
  select(name) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(random = list(rnorm(n = str_length(name)))) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

## Unnesting

To transform a list column into normal columns, use `unnest()`. Here's our tibble with a list column of country names.

```{r}
regions
```

Supply the `cols` argument of `unnest()` with the name of the columns to unnest.

```{r}
regions %>% 
  unnest(cols = countries)
```

## Manipulating

To manipulate list columns, you'll often find it helpful to use row-wise operations. For example, say we want to find the number of countries in each continent. Here's `regions` again.

```{r}
regions
```

We can't call `length()` directly on `countries`, because we'll just get the length of the entire column.

```{r}
regions %>% 
  mutate(num_countries = length(countries))
```

Instead, we need to iterate over each element or row of `countries` separately.

```{r}
regions %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(num_countries = nrow(countries)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

Note that we need to use `nrow()` because each element of `countries` is actually a tibble.

This code finds the proportion of a region's country names that end in "a".

```{r}
regions %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    ends_in_a = sum(str_detect(countries$name, "a$")) / nrow(countries)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(ends_in_a))
```
