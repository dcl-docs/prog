# purrr inside mutate

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

In the vector functions unit, you learned that `mutate()` creates new columns by creating vectors that contain an element for each row in the tibble. You saw that you can do any of the following to create this vector:

* Give `mutate()` a single value, which is then repeated for each row in the tibble.
* Explicitly give `mutate()` a vector with an element for each row in the tibble.
* Create a vector using a vector function like `+` or `case_when()`.

The purrr map functions are technically vector functions. They take a vector as input and return a vector of the same length as output. In this reading, we'll show you how to use map functions inside `mutate()` to create a new column.

`emoticons_1()` is a simple scalar function that turns feelings into emoticons.

```{r}
emoticons_1 <- function(x) {
  if (x == "happy") {
    ":)"
  } else if (x == "sad") {
    ":("
  } else {
    "Feeling too complex for emoticons"
  }
}
```

Recall that scalar functions take a single value and return a single value.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emoticons_1-scalar.png", dpi = image_dpi)
```

If you try to apply a scalar function to a vector, the scalar function will only process the first element of that vector.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emoticons_1-vector.png", dpi = image_dpi)
```

Let's say we want to use `emoticons_1()` to translate some feelings into emoticons. `df` is a small tibble that represents some feelings.

```{r}
df <- 
  tibble(
    feeling = c("sad", "compunctious", "happy")
  ) 
```

We can't just use `mutate()` and `emoticons_1()` to add a new column because, like we said, `emoticons_1()` can't handle vectors. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(emoticon = emoticons_1(feeling))
```

We could change `emoticons_1()` into a vector function by replacing `if` and `else` with `if_else()`, `case_when()`, or `recode()`. However, you often won't have control over the source code of the functions you want to use, and there will be many circumstances when you can't change a scalar function into a vector function.

Instead of turning `emoticons_1()` into a vector function, we'll use `map_chr()` to apply `emoticons_1()` to each element of `feeling`, creating a vector of emoticons.

You already know how to apply map functions to ordinary vectors. Let's pull `feeling` out of `df` to see what happens when we use `map_chr()` to apply `emoticons_1()`.

```{r}
feeling <- df$feeling

map_chr(feeling, emoticons_1)
```

Now, we can plug this map statement into `mutate()` to apply `emoticons_1()` to each feeling in `df`.

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(emoticon = map_chr(feeling, emoticons_1))
```

`map_chr()` does the same thing inside `mutate()` as it does outside. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emoticons-mutate-0.png", dpi = image_dpi)
```

The `feeling` column is just a vector, so the entire vector of emotions is supplied to `map_chr()`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emoticons-mutate-1.png", dpi = image_dpi)
```

Then, `map_chr()` applies `emoticons_1()` to each element of `feelings`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emoticons-mutate-2.png", dpi = image_dpi)
```

This results in a vector of values that `mutate()` can turn into a new column.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/emoticons-mutate-3.png", dpi = image_dpi)
```

You can use a map function inside `mutate()` to apply any scalar function to each element of a column, but remember to think about which map variant you need. If the output type of the scalar function doesn't match the map function suffix, you'll get an error about coercion.

```{r error=TRUE}
df %>% 
  mutate(emoticon = map_int(feeling, emoticons_1))
```

The map functions work exactly the same inside `mutate()` as they do outside. You still specify additional arguments by listing them after the function.

```{r}
emoticons_2 <- function(x, default = "???") {
  if (x == "happy") {
    ":)"
  } else if (x == "sad") {
    ":("
  } else {
    default
  }
}

df %>% 
  mutate(emoticon = map_chr(feeling, emoticons_2, default = NA_character_))
```

You can also still create anonymous functions.

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(statement = map_chr(feeling, ~ str_c("I feel ", emoticons_2(.))))
```

Remember that, in purrr functions, you start an anonymous function with `~`. The `.` refers to one element of the `feeling` column at a time. 

In the previous chapter, we demonstrated a strategy for creating anonymous functions. We'll show you how to apply this strategy when working with purrr functions inside `mutate()`.

The first step is still to assign an element of your input vector to `.`. Now, the input vector is a tibble column, so you'll need to first pull out the tibble column before accessing the first element.

```{r}
. <- df$feeling[[1]]
```

Next, you can build and test your function on `.`.

```{r}
str_c("I feel ", emoticons_2(.))
```

Finally, just copy and paste your function after a `~` inside your map call.

```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(statement = map_chr(feeling, ~ str_c("I feel ", emoticons_2(.))))
```
