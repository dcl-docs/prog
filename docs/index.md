# Welcome {-}

This book is a practical introduction to functional programming using the tidyverse.

## An evolving book {-}

This book is not intended to be static. Starting in April 2019, we use this book to teach functional programming in the Stanford [Data Challenge Lab](https://datalab.stanford.edu/challenge-lab) (DCL) course. The DCL functions as a testing ground for educational materials, as our students give us routine feedback on what they read and do in the course. We use this feedback to constantly improve our materials, including this book. The [source for the book](https://github.com/dcl-docs/prog) is also available on GitHub where we welcome suggestions for improvements.
